LoveYourScent applies a return and refund policy aligned with general e-commerce standards and common practices implemented by platforms such as Shopee.

1. Eligible Returns

Customers may request a return or exchange if:
- The product is defective or damaged upon delivery
- The product received does not match the description or order details
- An incorrect item was delivered

2. Return Conditions

Returned products must remain unused, unopened, and in their original packaging, including tags, seals, and accompanying accessories. Products showing signs of use, damage, or contamination are not eligible for return.

3. Return Request Procedure

Customers must contact our customer support team within the allowed return period to submit a return request. Returns sent without prior approval may be refused.

4. Refund Processing

Once the returned product is received and inspected, refunds will be processed using the original payment method. Refund processing time may vary depending on the payment provider and banking institution.

5. Non-Returnable Items

Certain items such as opened fragrance products or promotional goods may not be eligible for return due to hygiene and safety concerns.

LoveYourScent reserves the right to deny return or refund requests that do not meet the above conditions.
